    "text": "Our core feature, student behaviour management, allows teachers to record the daily behaviour of their students and they can view the summary through behaviour tracker. The behaviour tracker will show a visual graphical representation of the student behaviours over the period of time. It enables the teacher to evaluate whether he/she has to bring changes in their way of handling the children or is there a need to introduce new activities to help promote positive behaviour attitudes."
